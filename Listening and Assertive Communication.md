# Listening and Assertive Communication

## Steps/Strategies to do Active Listening

1. Give Your Full Attention: Show that you're present in the conversation by facing the speaker, maintaining eye contact, and avoiding distractions. 

2. Ask Questions for Clarity: Demonstrate understanding by asking relevant questions that encourage further explanation or clarify any unclear details. 

3. Acknowledge and Validate: Use verbal cues like "I see," or "I understand," to affirm that you're actively following the speaker's points. 

4. Paraphrase and Summarize: This helps verify your understanding and shows the speaker that you’re listening closely.

5. Avoid Interrupting: This respects their space to share and helps prevent misunderstandings that can come from jumping to conclusions too quickly.

## According to Fisher's model, these are some key points of Reflective Listening

1. Listen fully to understand the speaker's message.
2. Summarize and reflect back what you heard to confirm your understanding.
3. Acknowledge and empathize with the speaker’s feelings.

## Obstacles in your listening process

1. Distractions: External noise or internal thoughts can pull focus away from the speaker.
2. Prejudgments: Forming opinions or assumptions beforehand can block true understanding.
3. Emotional Reactions: Strong emotions may interfere with listening objectively.
4. Lack of Interest: If the topic seems uninteresting, it’s easier to lose focus or disengage.

## Steps to improve your listening

1. Practice Mindfulness: Stay present by consciously focusing on the speaker’s words rather than your own thoughts or responses.
2. Reflect and Summarize: Briefly paraphrase what you’ve heard to confirm your understanding and show the speaker they’ve been heard.
3. Ask Open-Ended Questions: Encourage deeper conversation by asking questions that let the speaker expand on their points.

## When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life
